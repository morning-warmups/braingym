## Question One
A traveller comes to a fork in the road which leads to two villages. In one village the people always tell lies, and in the other village the people always tell the truth. The traveller needs to conduct business in the village where everyone tells the truth. A man from one of the villages is standing in the middle of the fork, but there is no indication of which village he is from. The traveller approaches the man and asks him one question. From the villager's answer, he knows which road to follow. What did the traveller ask?

#### Answer:

The traveler asked **"which road goes to the your village?"**. He would then take the road the villager pointed to because if the villager was truthful he would point towards the truthful village. In the same way the liar would not point to his own village and therefore ultimately pointing towards the truthful village as well.

## Question Two
A man walks into an art gallery and concentrates on one picture in particular. The museum curator notices this and asks the man why he is so interested in that one painting. The man replies, "Brothers and sisters have I none, but that man's father is my father's son."

#### Answer:

The man's son

## Question Four
A man has to get a fox, a chicken, and a sack of corn across a river. He has a row boat, and it can only carry him and one other thing. If the fox and the chicken are left together, the fox will eat the chicken. If the chicken and the corn are left together, the chicken will eat the corn. How does the man do it?

#### Answer:

The man carries the chicken to cross the river first (leaving fox and the sack of corn). The man goes back to take the fox across the river, and since he can't leave the chicken and fox together, he brings the chicken back with him. He then leaves the chicken and take the sack of corn across and leaves it with the fox. He finally returns to pick up the chicken and heads across the river one last time.
