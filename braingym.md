He'll say  "which road goes to your village?". He would then take the route the person pointed to. The truthful person, would point to  his village, the truth village, right? Also, the liar would point to the truth village, the same village because he can't tell the truth. So, if the traveller wants to go the truth village, he knows which road to take. Then, if he wants to take the lie village, he would take that.
